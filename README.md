# ME-Conserved-NLS
High order mass and energy conserved scheme for solving the nonlinear Schrodinger equation 

* Basic codes: in ./Collocation/BaseMethod.py
* Using the implicit Newton iteration methods for solving the nonlinear system, testing codes for spatial and temporal convergence rates can be found in ./Implicit_Newton_Iter
* To run the code, add path of the basic codes and AuxiliaryPackages to PYTHONPATH
